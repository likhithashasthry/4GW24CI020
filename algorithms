1️⃣ Basic Array Concepts (Must Know)

Before algorithms, you should be comfortable with:
Traversing an array  ✅
Insertion & deletion ✅
Finding max / min
Reverse an array
Frequency count
 
📌 These are asked in coding rounds & MCQs

2️⃣ Searching Algorithms (Very Important)
🔹 Linear Search  ✅
Used when array is unsorted
Time: O(n)
🔹 Binary Search  ✅
Only for sorted arrays
Time: O(log n)
Variants asked:
First & last occurrence
Count of an element
Search in rotated sorted array

3️⃣ Sorting Algorithms (Placement Favorite)
🔹 Bubble Sort (basic understanding)
🔹 Selection Sort   ✅
🔹 Insertion Sort
📌 Understand logic + time complexity
🔹 Merge Sort
Divide & Conquer
Used in large data problems
🔹 Quick Sort
Very common in interviews

4️⃣ Two Pointer Technique ⭐ (VERY IMPORTANT)

Used when working with:
Sorted arrays
Pairs / subarrays
Common problems:
Pair with given sum
Remove duplicates
Reverse array
Move zeros to end
Merge two sorted arrays

5️⃣ Sliding Window Technique ⭐⭐

Used for subarray problems
Problems include:
Maximum sum subarray of size k
Longest subarray with sum k
Count subarrays satisfying condition
📌 Frequently asked in product companies

6️⃣ Prefix Sum Technique
Used to optimize repeated sum calculations

Problems:
Range sum queries
Subarray sum equals k
Equilibrium index

7️⃣ Kadane’s Algorithm ⭐

Used for:
Maximum subarray sum
Time: O(n)
📌 Very frequently asked

8️⃣ Hashing with Arrays

Use:
Frequency array
HashMap

Problems:
Find duplicates
Missing number
Majority element
Two sum

9️⃣ Array Rearrangement Problems

Examples:
Rotate array (left/right)
Rearrange positive & negative numbers
Alternate elements
Sort 0s, 1s, and 2s (Dutch National Flag Algorithm ⭐)

🔟 Advanced Array Problems (For Top Companies)
Trapping Rain Water
Container With Most Water
Maximum product subarray
Stock buy & sell
Subarray with XOR

📌 Interview Must-Do Problems (Arrays)
